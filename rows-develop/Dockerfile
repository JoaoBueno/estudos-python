#thrift (used by parquet plugin) is the only which needs build-essential and
#python-dev to be installed (installing python-thrift doesn't do the job).

#You can build other Python libraries from source by installing:
#  libsnappy-dev libxml2-dev libxslt-dev libz-dev
#and not installing:
#  python-lxml python-snappy

# configure locale (needed to run tests)
RUN echo 'en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8' > /etc/locale.gen
RUN echo 'pt_BR.UTF-8 UTF-8' >> /etc/locale.gen
